## ðŸ§ª Testing (Optional)
You can test the APIs using tools like Postman or `curl`.

## ðŸ’¡ Notes
Optional modules such as real-time synchronization and the Python reporting utility were not implemented. This is primarily because my experience and current development environment are focused on JavaScript and Node.js. I have not worked with Python, so I chose to focus on building a robust and well-tested core API.
